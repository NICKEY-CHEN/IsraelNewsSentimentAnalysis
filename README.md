# IsraelNewsSentimentAnalysis
This is the backend of the Israel News Sentiment Analysis project. The backend crawls given urls(mostly news) and finds Israel related content. After crawling the content, a sentiment analysis Spark cluster analyzes the data and returns urls which have negative sentiment towards Israel back to the frontend.
